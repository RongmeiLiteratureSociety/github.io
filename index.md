# Rongmei Literature Society

Welcome to the official website of the **Rongmei Literature Society (RLS)** — a community-driven initiative dedicated to the preservation, documentation, and promotion of the Rongmei language, literature, and cultural heritage.

---

## 🌍 Our Mission

- Preserve and promote the **Rongmei language** through linguistic research, community collaboration, and cultural documentation.
- Create open-access digital resources — including a dictionary, grammar guides, and audio archives — for learners, educators, and linguists.
- Develop a structured, searchable dataset that will support **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **AI-driven language tools** in the future.
- Empower Rongmei speakers to engage with technology in their own language — from educational tools to voice assistants.
- Ensure that the Rongmei language not only survives — but **thrives** in the digital age.
